Mobile context-aware systems will offer entirely new opportunities for application developers by gathering and analyzing huge amount of network topology and a mobile user activity context data. Mobile context-aware services incorporate network context information about current location of a mobile user with additional social activity context to provide more relevant location aware services. Several research challenges for a mobile user context analytics, including how can various types of semantic context be represented for effective automatic processing, how can the semantic context be integrated together to discover hidden valuable information for new services through analytics and learning. Last but not least challenge is how to provide privacy preserving semantic context analytics without jeopardizing a mobile user personal privacy. Mobile network system operators could posses network topology information along with a mobile userâ€™s activity data. But this data is an asset so kept secret. On the other hand, open databases providers, such as OpenCellID and OpenBMap, allow people to access the entire free dataset. OpenMobileNetwork is another open source project for providing approximated network topology data based on the principles of Linked Open Data (LOD) with business concept for mobile network system operators to exploit their valuable asset. In this chapter, we exploit the challenge on how to keep balancing between a mobile user semantic context analytics and privacy protection. When we combine network topology dataset from OpenMobileNetwork with the other interlinked semantic dataset, such as DBpedia, SKOS, in the LOD cloud, it has the potential to enable semantically enriched innovative new services that current mobile network system operators cannot achieve but a mobile user privacy still can be ensured.
